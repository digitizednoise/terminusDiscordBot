# terminusDiscordBot

***FOR EMPLOYMENT PURPOSES ONLY***

This is a personal bot I created for a small discord server I made for my friends and I using discord.js. I host it loaclly on a personal Raspberry Pi 4 running Ubuntu MATE. 

It started off as a bot that added / removed roles for members  in the server; the roles were just all the different types of games we all played in the server.
It allowed for us to communicate easier when we were requesting party members or opponents for games we played.

I try to add examples and for my bot's text to be as clear as possible, I find examples can be really useful for users when guiding them to use your bot; structure and presentation as well.

I plan on adding a module / command that allows members to request the current weather via zip code, I figure it would be a nice thing to share amongst ourselves.
